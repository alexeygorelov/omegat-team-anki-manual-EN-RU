# Installing & Upgrading Anki on macOS

<!-- toc -->

## Requirements

Recent Anki releases require a Mac running macOS 10.13.4 or later.

The last Anki release that supported macOS 10.10 to 10.13.3 was
2.1.35-alternate. If you're on an old machine, you can obtain the old
version from the [releases
page](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases).

## Installing

1. Download Anki from <https://apps.ankiweb.net>
2. Save the file to your desktop or downloads folder.
3. Open it, and drag Anki to your Applications folder or desktop.
4. Double-click on Anki in the location you placed it.

## Upgrading

To upgrade, close Anki if it is open, and then follow the steps above. Drag
the Anki icon into the same location you previously stored it, and when prompted,
overwrite the old version. Your card data will be preserved.

## Add-on Compatibility

Some add-ons have not been updated to support the latest Anki release yet. If an
add-on you depend on has not been ported to the latest release yet, you may have
more luck with 2.1.44 from the [releases
page](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases).
